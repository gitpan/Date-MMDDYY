Date::MMDDYY - Converts a epoch time format string to MM-DD-YY

Install instructions:

# perl Makefile.PL
# make
# make test
# make install

Example:

 use Date::MMDDYY;
 
 $time_string = time();
 $date = datecon($time_string); 

# or 

 $date = datecon("$time_string", "MM,YY", "/");

# or 

 $date = datecon("$time_string", "", "_");

# or 

 $date = datecon("$time_string", "MM,DD", "");

Usage:

datecon("$time_string", "$format", "$delemiter");

$time_string contains the output of the time(); function,
or an epoch time stamp. 

$format should be a comma seperated list of the variables you want 
(no spaces). Accepted are MM for month, DD for day, and YY for year.
They should be in the order you want them output as. If you want the
default (MM,DD,YY) just provide blank quotes, otherwise you will 
receive an error.
 
$delemiter should contain, well, what you want to use as the 
delemiter. If nothing is provided, "-" will be used as default.


If you just want the standard MM-DD-YY output you just just provide
the $time_string and nothing else.
